      <p>Most things decay because they were designed for attention, not time. They peak quickly, exhaust their usefulness, and leave behind only the memory of having been everywhere.</p>

      <p>Artifacts are built differently.</p>

      <p>They don’t chase immediacy. They assume delay. They leave space for time to do its work. What appears understated in the present often reveals itself as precise in hindsight. What felt quiet turns out to have been measured.</p>

      <p>This is why certain verses, paintings, films, or sentences feel more authoritative years later than they did at release. Time doesn’t erode them. It clarifies them. Each passing year removes surrounding noise and leaves the object standing more alone, more legible.</p>

      <p>A Michael Jordan rookie card gains value because history keeps agreeing with the original claim. Jordan doesn’t need reintroduction. His dominance is settled. The object simply sits, letting inevitability compound.</p>

      <p>That’s the logic underneath the line.</p>

      <p>Not greatness in the moment,<br/>but correctness over time.</p>

      <p>When someone knows a verse without being prompted, that verse has crossed into permanence. It has become reference material—something retrieved to explain the world, not escape it.</p>

      <p>Mint condition isn’t preservation for its own sake.<br/>It’s alignment.</p>

      <p>When craft, restraint, and intention line up cleanly, time stops being a threat and becomes an ally. History begins working for the object instead of against it.</p>

      <p>That is the deepest flex culture allows.</p>

      <p>Not to be heard everywhere,<br/>but to be remembered anywhere.</p>
