    <section class="body">
      <p>There’s a difference between hearing something and knowing it.</p>

      <p>Most things are heard once and discarded. They pass through the ear and leave no residue. Knowing requires a different level of engagement. Attention. Repetition. Memory. Submission.</p>

      <p>You don’t know a verse accidentally.</p>

      <p>To know a verse is to have made room for it. Space in the mind is finite. Anything that stays displaces something else. So when a line survives—when it can be summoned without a screen or a prompt—it has already passed a silent test.</p>

      <p>This is why the phrase lands the way it does.</p>

      <p>Knowing a verse is not about fandom. It’s about internalization. The work no longer belongs to the artist alone. It has crossed into private language. It gets used to explain things. To measure moments. To name feelings that didn’t have words before.</p>

      <p>That’s a higher threshold than replay.</p>

      <p>Replay is convenience.<br/>Knowing is commitment.</p>

      <p>A song can be enjoyed passively. It can score a moment and disappear with it. A verse has to be learned. Learning requires effort. And effort is the clearest signal of value we have.</p>

      <p>This is how artifacts form.</p>

      <p>Cultural objects don’t become durable because they are everywhere. They become durable because they are chosen—again and again—by individuals who decide, consciously or not, that this thing is worth carrying.</p>

      <p>Quotation is evidence of survival.</p>

      <p>When someone reaches for a line from memory, they’re not consuming it. They’re using it. The verse has become a tool. A reference point. A small piece of mental infrastructure.</p>

      <p>This is why the flex doesn’t need elaboration.</p>

      <p>If people know a verse, the work has already done its job. It doesn’t need explanation, defense, or amplification. It has crossed from performance into possession.</p>

      <p>That’s the quiet math underneath the claim.</p>

      <p>Not how many heard it.<br/>How many kept it.</p>
